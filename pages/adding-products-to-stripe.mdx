# Adding Products to Stripe

Let's create a product in Stripe so that users can upgrade their accounts to become Premium Users.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ“£"> **Important:** Do not add products before your extension is fully installed and the webhook is set up. Adding a product triggers the webhook, so if the installation isn't complete, your product might not appear until you update it. </Callout>
1. Create a New Product in Stripe

- Access the Stripe Dashboard.

- In the left-hand menu, click on Products.

- Click on the Add Product button.

- Enter Product Details:

  1. Product Name: Give your product a name, such as "Monthly Plan" or "Yearly Plan".
  2. Description: Optionally, provide a brief description of the product.

- Configure the Product:

  1. Set the correct price.

  2. Choose the type of charge (recurring, one-time, etc.).

  3. Configure any other options according to your needs.

The default subscription component in SaaSavant expects two products/prices. Customize this to fit your specific requirements.

2. Add Stripe priceIds to Environment Variables

- Copy the Price ID:

  1. After creating your product, click on it in the Stripe Dashboard.
  2. In the popup menu, select Copy Price ID.
  
Update Your `.env.local` File:

Open the `.env.local` file in your projectâ€™s root directory.

Paste the copied Price ID into the appropriate variable, for example:

```env
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_MONTHLY_ID=your_monthly_price_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_YEARLY_ID=your_yearly_price_id_here
```

Replace your_monthly_price_id_here and your_yearly_price_id_here with the actual Price IDs you copied.

Save Your Changes:

Ensure you save the `.env.local` file after pasting in the Price IDs.
Repeat for Additional Products:

If you have multiple products, repeat the process to add each product&apos;s Price ID to the `.env.local` file.

---

You're all set! Your Stripe products are now configured, and the Price IDs are stored in your environment variables.
