# Toast Notifications with React-Toastify

In this guide, you'll learn how to use `react-toastify` to display toast notifications in your application. The setup in the `RootLayout` file already includes a pre-configured `ToastContainer`, so all you need to do is import `toast` and use it in your components.

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use `react-toastify` in a component:

```jsx
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    toast.success("Operation was successful!");
  };

  const handleError = () => {
    toast.error("Something went wrong.");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleSuccess}>Show Success Toast</button>
      <button onClick={handleError}>Show Error Toast</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

## Explanation

1. **import `toast` from `react-toastify`**: At the top of your component, import `toast` from `react-toastify`. This will allow you to trigger notifications.

2. **Trigger Notifications**: Use `toast.success`, `toast.error`, `toast.info`, or `toast.warn` to display different types of notifications. These methods accept a message as a string.

3. **Toast Types**:

- **Success**: toast.success("Operation was successful!");
- **Error**: toast.error("Something went wrong.");
- **Info**: toast.info("Here is some information.");
- **Warning**: toast.warn("This is a warning!");

## Customizing the Toast Container

If you want to customize the behavior or appearance of the `ToastContainer`, you can edit the settings in the `RootLayout` file. For example, you can change the theme, position, auto-close duration, etc.

```jsx
<ToastContainer
  position="bottom-center"
  autoClose={3000}
  hideProgressBar
  newestOnTop
  closeOnClick
  rtl={false}
  pauseOnFocusLoss
  draggable
  pauseOnHover
  theme="light" // Change this to "dark" for a dark theme
/>
```

You can adjust the `position`, `autoClose` time, and even switch to a `dark` theme if desired. Any changes here will apply globally to all toasts in your application.

Now you're all set to use `react-toastify` in your application!
