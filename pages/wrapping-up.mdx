# Wrapping Up

Let's wrap up real quick by finishing up our .env file.

---

### **Site URL and Functions URL**

The Nextjs project utilizes server side api calls, this means we need a fully qualified URL to hit our own API.

To solve the we have this env variable:

```sh
# Config
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=""
```

Since we have not set this env variable yet, it will fallback to http://localhost:3000 for development purposes.

When deploying, you should update it to the deployed url of your project, for example:

If your url is https://saasavant.vercel.app

Your env var would look like this

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://saasavant.vercel.app"
```

### **Congrats**

Your project should be setup and ready for development. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run  dev` from the terminal in the root directory of your porject to start the development server.

If you are using Stripe Development Mode API Keys (recommended while developing and testing), you can use a 'test' credit card to mock a payment and ensure successful subscription creation. See the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards) for more details.

To get the development keys, head to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

When you are done testing, replace the keys in the `.env.local` file with your live keys and turn off the development mode in the Stripe Dashboard.
