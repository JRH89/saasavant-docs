## Introduction

SaaSavant is a robust and feature-rich SaaS boilerplate designed to accelerate your software-as-a-service project. Built with the latest technologies and best practices, SaaSavant provides a strong foundation for any SaaS application, whether you're building a simple tool or a complex platform.

## Key Features

### Authentication and Authorization

SaaSavant includes a secure and scalable authentication system powered by Firebase Authentication. It supports a preconfigured sign-in flow using email and password.

Other authentication methods, such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub, can be added as well by enabling them from the Firebase dashboard.

Additionally, role-based authorization ensures that users have access only to the parts of the application they need.
