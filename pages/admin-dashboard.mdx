## Granting Admin Access in Firebase Firestore

### Create Your First User

Now that the necessary environment variables are set and the SaaSavant dependencies are installed, you can create your first user. This can either be a temporary test user or a real user that you can set as an Admin. Setting a user as Admin will allow you to access the SaaSavant Admin dashboard and manage your SaaS product as mentioned earlier.

Once this is done the first time and you have access to the Admin Dashboard, you can grant or remove Admin access for any user. The following setup process is only required to grant Admin access to the first Admin user.

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

2. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to the `Signup` page.

4. Enter your credentials (email and password) then submit the form.

To grant admin access, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Firebase Console:**

   - Open your web browser and go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Select your project from the list.

2. **Access the Firestore Dashboard:**

   - In the left-hand menu, click on **Firestore Database**.

3. **Locate the Users Collection:**

   - In the Firestore Database pane, find and click on the **Users** collection to expand it.

4. **Find the User Document:**

   - Look for the user document you recently created, it should be theonly one in the collection. Click on the document to open it.

5. **Change `isAdmin` Field:**

- By default, all users are set to `false`. To grant admin access, set the `isAdmin` field to `true`.

6. **Save and Confirm Changes:**

   - Ensure that the `isAdmin` field is set to `true`.
   - Click the `Save` button.

> **Note:** You can set as many users as you want to be Admins. However, be cautious when assigning Admin rights, as granting these privileges to the wrong person can have significant security implications.

The Admin Dashboard in SaaSavant provides a comprehensive interface for managing your application.
