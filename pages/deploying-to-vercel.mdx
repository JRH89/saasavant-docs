## Step 1: Push the Code to a Git Repository

Vercel automatically deploys from Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Ensure your project code is pushed to a repository.

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add your project code to the repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. Push your changes to the remote repository:

Replace `your-username` and `repo-name` with your GitHub username and repository name.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. Click `Add New Project`.
