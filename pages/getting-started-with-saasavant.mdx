# Getting Started with SaaSavant

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: Version 18 (or higher)
- npm: Version 8 (or higher)
- Next.js: Version 14 (or higher)

## Installation
Open your terminal.

Navigate to your project directory by running:
```
bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):

```
bash
git init
```

Add and commit your files:

Before you make any custom changes to the project, it's essential to commit the original boilerplate code. This will allow you to reuse the boilerplate later by cloning the unaltered version.

```
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Push to a remote repository:

Next, push your initial boilerplate to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub or GitLab). This will serve as the unmodified version of your project that you can easily reuse in the future.

```
bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

Important: Once you've pushed the boilerplate to the remote repository, it's a good idea to remove the remote origin to avoid accidentally pushing any future changes to the boilerplate. This ensures your original version remains intact.

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

Why this step is important: By pushing the unaltered boilerplate to a remote repository, you create a clean, reusable version. Later, if you want to start a new project or return to the original boilerplate, you can simply clone this repository. This ensures the core boilerplate remains intact while giving you flexibility to edit future versions.

Install project dependencies using npm:

```
bash
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies for your project.

Next Steps
Edit the `siteMetadata.js` file:

Open the `siteMetadata.js` file in the root of your project and fill in the missing information (e.g., project name, description). Leave any fields blank that donâ€™t apply yet, such as API keys, which will be configured later.

Edit the `.env.local` file:

Open the `.env.local` file and fill in the required environment variables (e.g., API keys). You can leave certain fields blank if they donâ€™t apply right now.

Next: Configuring Firebase
Now that your project is set up, move on to configuring Firebase to complete the setup process.
