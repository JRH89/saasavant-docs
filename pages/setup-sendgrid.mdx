# Setting Up SendGrid and Configuring Your API Key

1. Create a SendGrid Account

Sendgrid offers a free account with a sending limit of 100 emails per day.
If you need a higher limit, sign up for a premium account.

- Open your browser and navigate to [SendGrid&apos;s website](https://sendgrid.com/).
- Click on **Sign Up** and follow the on-screen instructions to create your account.

2. Generate Your API Key

- Once logged in, go to the **Settings** tab on the left-hand sidebar.
- Click on **API Keys**.
- Click **Create API Key** and provide a name for your key (e.g., "MyProject API Key").
- Choose the appropriate permissions for your key (Full Access is recommended for most use cases).
- Click **Create & View**. Your API key will be displayedâ€”copy it immediately as you won&apos;t be able to view it again.

3. Approve a "From" Email Address

- Navigate to the **Sender Authentication** section in the Settings menu.
- Click **Verify a Single Sender**.
- Fill out the form with your email address and other required details.
- Click **Create**.
- SendGrid will send a verification email to the address you provided. Open that email and click on the verification link to approve the address.

4. Add Your API Key to the .env File

- Open your project&apos;s root directory.
- Locate the `.env.local` file or create one if it doesn&apos;t exist.
- Add your SendGrid API key to the `.env.local` file as follows:

```env
Copy code
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
```

- Replace your_sendgrid_api_key_here with the actual API key you copied earlier.

5. Use Your Verified Email Address

Set the verified email address as the value of the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` variable located in the `.env.local` file.
